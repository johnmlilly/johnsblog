As a kid, I was obsessed with building and creating things. My go-to? Legos. I’d spend hours snapping together Star Wars sets—X-Wings, TIE Fighters, even my own custom start fighter. For me, it wasn’t just play; it was figuring out how pieces fit, how to make something cool from a pile of bricks. That knack for building things stuck with me. In college, I studied communication, but my real passion was messing with websites—tweaking designs, digging into how they worked. I loved the puzzle of it, like rebuilding a Lego set in digital form.

Fast forward to 2020 when Covid hit. I was in a dead-end job, going nowhere fast, and I needed to find a way out. Not just for me, but to build a better life for my family. Coding felt like my shot at a better life—like Luke Skywalker hopping in his X-Wing to chase something bigger. I had two goals, which I typed into a Notion folder (and still keep there today):

1. Support my family with a stable, solid income.
2. Find a flexible work-life balance—ideally working from home—so I could actually be there for my family.

With those targets locked in, I set off to learn coding and web development.

ting out. Plus, it’s a chance to geek out about Star Wars while I’m at it—because if I can code my way to a better life, so can you. Stick around, and let’s build something awesome together!
