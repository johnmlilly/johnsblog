As a kid, I was obsessed with building and creating things. My go-to? Legos. I’d spend hours snapping together Star Wars sets—X-Wings, TIE Fighters, even my own custom start fighter. For me, it wasn’t just play; it was figuring out how pieces fit, how to make something cool from a pile of bricks. That knack for building things stuck with me. In college, I studied communication, but my real passion was messing with websites—tweaking designs, digging into how they worked. I loved the puzzle of it, like rebuilding a Lego set in digital form.

Fast forward to 2020 when Covid hit. I was in a dead-end job, going nowhere fast, and I needed to find a way out. Not just for me, but to build a better life for my family. Coding felt like my shot at a better life—like Luke Skywalker hopping in his X-Wing to chase something bigger. I had two goals, which I typed into a Notion folder (and still keep there today):

1.  Support my family with a stable, solid income.
    
2.  Find a flexible work-life balance—ideally working from home—so I could actually be there for my family.
    

With those targets locked in, I set off to learn coding and web development.

## The Start

I created a Notion folder to track everything: daily progress, notes, useful links, even chats with developers already in the field. It was my mission control. Every morning before work, I’d tackle coding challenges on sites like Codewars and LeetCode—small battles to sharpen my skills. After a while, I switched to freeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certification to nail down HTML and CSS basics.

After several months of honing my skills, I took on the five projects needed for the certification. Building those felt like constructing my own star fighter—challenging, but I could see it coming together. Once I finished, I started applying for jobs in the field. Rejection emails from recruiters piled up, but I kept pushing, trusting my opportunity would come.

I applied for an entry-level developer role at Apple FCU, a place I’d applied to before my dead-end gig. Having a connection there gave me a boost, and I crushed the technical interview challenge. All those months of coding practice paid off—I wasn’t just swinging in the dark anymore. They offered me the job, and I jumped at it. Since then, I’ve never stopped growing, learning more about web development and crafting user-friendly apps.

## My Approach to Coding Challenges

Every coding problem I encountered offered me an opportunity to strengthen my skills. To help me, I devised this plan for each problem:

### 3 Tips for Approaching a Project Critically

1.  **Understand the Problem**: Figure out what’s going in (inputs) and what needs to come out (outputs).
    
2.  **Devise a Plan**: Write pseudocode—a rough sketch of steps, like mapping a hyperspace route.
    
3.  **Carry Out the Plan**: Turn that sketch into real code—bring it to life!
    
4.  **Look Back**: Check your work and tweak it to run smoother or faster.
    

I still use this method today—it keeps me focused and sharp.

## Why I Chose Coding + Programming

Coding wasn’t a random choice—it’s been part of me since my Lego days. As a kid, I’d spend hours tinkering with Lego sets, experimenting with different sets, solving the puzzle of how to make them work. That drive to create and figure things out never left me. In college, I started playing with websites, tweaking code to see what happened. I realized I loved technical challenges—diving into problems, breaking them down, and building solutions. Web development clicked because it’s like those Lego projects: a mix of creativity, logic, and constant tinkering. Here’s why it fits me:

1.  **It’s a Growing Path**: There’s always more to learn—JavaScript, frameworks, new tools. Every challenge is a chance to get better and improve your skillset.
    
2.  **It’s My Own: I’m in Control**: I’m choosing this career path and shaping it to fit my life, not the other way around. My family comes first and having a flexible work-life balance in this field is the perfect fit for me.
    
3.  **It Matches Me**: I’m a builder at heart—Legos, websites, apps—and I thrive on solving tough problems. I love digging into a challenge. I’m not a designer by trade, but I’ve improved by learning CSS and crafting simple, minimalistic designs. It’s like building a Lego model: every piece has to fit just right to create a smooth, functional experience.
    

## Best Advice I Got

As I was meeting professionals in the field and reconnecting with friends already working in tech, a mentor gave me this advice that never left me:

> “Find what you like and stick with it—don’t stress about the end result. If you enjoy it, you’ll keep learning.”

That stuck with me. I love the puzzle of coding, the way it clicks when a solution works. It’s why I’m still here, plugging away.

## Where I’m At Now

Today, I’m a web developer at Apple FCU, working on projects that make sites and apps easier to use. I’m still learning—JavaScript, frameworks like React, debugging tricks—and I’ll share it all here. This blog is my way to process what I’m picking up, reflect on my journey, and maybe help someone else starting out. Plus, it’s a chance to geek out about Star Wars while I’m at it—because if I can code my way to a better life, so can you. Stick around, and let’s build something awesome together!
