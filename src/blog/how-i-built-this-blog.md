### Research
Researched various options
Wanted something easy to post to
Didn’t want to use Wordpress, squarespace
Looked into SSG and found a few options such as Astro, Jekyll, and 11ty
The latter stood out for his supporting community, open source commitment and easy setup and great documentation.
### Getting started
As I began reading through the documentation, I found several tutorials to help get me started. One in particular was by Kevin Powell, the King of CSS, who I’ve followed for several years and owe so much of my knowledge and skill of how to work and master CSS with front end technologies.
He had a tutorial on using the JAMStack for creating a blog with 11ty, Netlify, and a custom open-source CMS. This seemed like the perfect fit!
